# PS-PSH File-Receiver
Used to download files from the PS-PSH server.

# Downloading a File/Directory
Use a GUI:
- (GUI Windows) Download from releases. (Built with auto-py-to-exe) -> _Note: The EXE maybe flagged as a false positive by your Antivirus_
- (GUI Mac) Download from releases. (Built with py2app and create-dmg)

Use the command promt:
- (Python Script) Download /src/ps-psh-receiver-command.py


Either of these methods will create a file/directory with the corresponding name and file extension in your chosen directory.

# Next Steps
- Improve the transmission of multiple files (Directories)
- Improve the Windows version of the GUI to eliminate false Antivirus positives
