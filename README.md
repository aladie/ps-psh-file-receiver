# PS-PSH File-Receiver
Used to download files from the PS-PSH server.

# Downloading a File
Use a GUI:
- (GUI Windows) Download from releases. (Built with auto-py-to-exe) -> _Note: The EXE maybe flagged as a false positive by your Antivirus_
- (GUI Mac) Download from releases. (Built with py2app and create-dmg)

Use the command promt:
- (Python Script) Download /src/ps-psh-receiver-command.py

Either of these methods will crerate a file called _PS-PSH-OUTPUT_ in your choosen directory.

_Currently you will have to add the filename and file extention yourself._

# Next Steps
- Support the transmission of the filename and file extention
- Support the transmission of multiple files (Directories)
- Improve the Windows version of the GUI to eliminate false Antivirus positives
